# Custom Object Detector


#### Training Data
Add the training data to `./data/raw_images/` folder. It is recommended to use jpg images.

#### Resizing Images
The training images should have unique names and equal sizes. You can use `./resize_images.py` for resizing the images. The resized images will be saved in `./data/resized_images/` folder.

#### Test and Train Data
Split the images in the resized images directory into test and train data. You can use 80 percent of the images as train data and the rest as test data. Add the training images to `./data/train/` and test images to `./data/test/`

#### Labelling Images
You can use https://tzutalin.github.io/labelImg/ for labelling images.
